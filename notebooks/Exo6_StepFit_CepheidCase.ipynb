    "# Fit a Step â€“ Exercise 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Base on the `Intrinsic Dispersion` fitting class you created last week create a new class that allow to **fit a step**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a physical process having a transition at a given threshold value. This could for instance be applied to astrophysics. Cepheids (pulsating stars) have an average magnitude (luminosity in log-scale) `m0` if their pulsating period is lower than, say, `10` and an average magnitude `m1` otherwise (nb: this is not true in real life). Each group has a natural dispersion of `sigma0` and `sigma1`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The pulsation and magnitude of each stars have been measured (see data) and we want to derive the average magnitudes (`m0`, `m1`) and natural dispersions (`sigma0`, `sigma1`) for the Cepheids.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are recorded in `data/Cepheid_StepFit.dat`\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data and the probability for a star to be in the low- and high-frequency pulsation group\n",
    "\n",
    "The data have errors both on the pulsation and manitude measurements. **All errors are gaussian errors** \n",
    "Because of the errors on the pulsation measurements, a given star will have a probability `p0` to belong to the low-pulsation group (below `10`) and a probability `p1=1-p0` to belong to the high-pulsation one.\n",
